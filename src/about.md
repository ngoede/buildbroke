Nick is a software developer and development coach. He currently works at Derivative Path, a financial services company. He has been working with and advocating for eXtreme Programming for over a decade, especially the developer practices it includes such as pairing and TDD. Lately, he has been thinking a lot about product development and how to create product teams within an organization instead of project teams.
