## What is Legacy Code ##

Legacy code means lots of things to different people. Generally though, most can agree that code that is hard to understand, hard to change or both is legacy code. Micheal Feathers in his book [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131177052/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_PcTxDbGHF7KWE) the defines legacy code as code that has no automated tests. As Micheal is part of the eXtreme Programming tradition when he says automated tests he means small fast tests where each test is focused on only a small part of the code. eXtreme Programming refers to these as Unit Tests. For more about what these sorts of tests look like and ways you might write them I recommend Anthony Sciamanna's article [xUnit is not Unit Testing](https://anthonysciamanna.com/2014/12/06/xunit-is-not-unit-testing.html).
